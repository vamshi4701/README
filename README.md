# HOW CODE WORKS
- I have used python language to write the code
- first step is to create a class called solution
- create dictionary for each newspaper along with their subscription fee for each day
- now create a function to calculate total subscription fee for whole week
- finally create a function which returns all the possible combiations of newspapers within the given budget
- To run this code create a class and pass budget and call comb function to get all the possible combinations.
